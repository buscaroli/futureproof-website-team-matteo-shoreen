# Working as a Team and Collaborating with git and gitHub
This was a challenge given to us by the Futureproof Tutor on day 4 of the Bootcamp (Auguste cohort).

## Objective
Get a random page from the Wikipedia Roulette [[http://wikiroulette.co/][WikiRoulette]], create a simple webpage about the topic by:

1. Choosing a planning tool (eg Figma)
2. Choosing executing tools (eg Bootstrap)
3. Push the code to a gitHub repo
4. Deploy the website on Netlify by syncing it with gitHub.
5. Discuss the biggest challenges:
** collaborating with git and gitHub for the first time
** using Bootstrap without having used it before
** time: only 2 hours given
6. Biggest win (having deployed the website even if struggled a bit)
7. What would you do differently:
** start pushing and merging earlier and do it consistently
** learning the tools beforehand (but we are here to learn and to challenge ourselves! üí™ )
